# Parnassus
## A species counterpoint validator

Parnassus is a tool for validating notated music according to the rules stated in Johann Joseph Fux's *Gradus ad Parnassum*, a classic educational text for learning contrapuntal harmony.
*Gradus ad Parnassum* provides a set of compositional approaches (referred to as "species"), which grow progressively more complex and are governed by strict rulesets.
This approach to pedagogy is known as "species counterpoint".

This project aims to provide a full-featured validation suite for the first two contrapuntal species Fux outlines in *Gradus*.
This is a useful resource for any student of classical harmony, as it will notice easily-missed compositional errors.
I see this as a useful practice tool, and am personally compelled to implement it because I think the rigidity of Fux's approach inherently translates well into a computational problem.
I also see the development process of this program as a good opportunity to solidify my knowledge of contrapuntal harmony.
